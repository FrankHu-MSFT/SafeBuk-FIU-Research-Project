# SafeBuk

This is a short Android Application that utilizes Regex and Data Scraping on Facebook profiles using JSoup in order to determine if the friend request is fake or real or not. It will then do a Javascrip Injection to modify the HTML of the friend request to make it red, yellow, or green depending on the integrity of the profile.
