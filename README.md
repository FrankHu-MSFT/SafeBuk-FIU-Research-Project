# SafeBuk

This is a short Android Application that utilizes Regex and Data Scraping on Facebook profiles using JSoup in order to determine if the friend request is fake or real or not. It will then do a Javascript Injection to modify the HTML of the friend request to make it red, yellow, or green depending on the integrity of the profile. 

## Deprecated

No future plans on support for this repository. Associated libraries are old and feel free to utilize this at your own risk. Will most likely need to update libraries and update code to work properly in 2019+.
